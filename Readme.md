# Covid Sypmton Tracker

We have developed a simple application using **HTML**, **CSS** and **PHP**.
The application provides two interface login one is the ***patient side*** in which the patient can see the medicines prescrided to him by doctor along with any other specific details.
the Patient can also update is day to day details which are *Body Temperature, Oxygen Saturation, Loss of Smell and Loss of Taste* which are important measures for covid virus.

The ***doctor side*** interface has options to see many patients all together and see individual patients trends by graphs and prescriding new medicines and other important details.

This app was designed based on the idea that every patient was unable to visit doctor during the pandemic and it was risk as well thus an online simple platform for the same.
